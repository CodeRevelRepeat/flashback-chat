A simple web chat app reminiscent of AOL including emojis :) (of course)

## Tech stack

Flashback Chat is built with React/Flux on the front-end and Node/Express on the back-end.  There is a PostgreSQL database set up with Sequelize.  Socket.io enables real-time chat.  

Gulp is used to automate the build.  

## Development

To run locally:

1) npm install
2) bower install
3) set up PostgreSQL database named 'chatApp' with user-name 'chatter1'
4) use command 'gulp' to start server
5) app runs on localhost:3000
